1. This visualization explores the relationship between usergroup and age/gender demographics. While the age distribution is similar between the genders, a distinct shift in the age distribution can be observed when comparing subscribers and non-subscribing customers. The subscribers tend to be older than non-subscribers, this makes sense because if a new user finds themselves using the service repetitively, they will in time seek out a subscription.

2. This visualization shows the different starting and ending locations filtered by gender, day of the week, and usertype. We can clearly see that the greatest number of rides are taken by male subscribers, this is consisten across the days of the week. We can also see that non-subscribing customers have a tendency to pick up and drop off their bikes at locations around Central Park and the Hudson suggesting these users are tourists. We can also see that subscribers during the workweek tend to pick up and drop off their bikes at locations in central Manhattan suggesting that they use the service for their daily commute to and from work.

3. This visualization explores the relationship between starttime and both usertype and gender. The most important insight we can gleen from these charts is that subscribers tend to use the service more during the weekday commute, while non-subscribing customers' peak usage is spread throughout the day on weekends. This supports our observations from the previous visualization about subscribers being locals commuting to and from work and non-subscribers being tourists.

4. This vizualization shows the weekly usage by men and women users for a side-by-side comparison, and shows us where these users started and ended their trips. Again, we see the peaks during commute hours during the workweek and consistent use throughout the day on weekends.
